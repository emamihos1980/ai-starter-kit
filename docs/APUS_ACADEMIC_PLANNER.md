## Session planning rules (how we pick next 3 courses)
### Goal
- Keep pace: 3 courses / 8 weeks (9 credits)

### Load balancing (recommended)
- Max 1 “heavy math” course per session (Calc II/III, Diff Eq, Probability, Multivariate)
- Pair with:
  - 1 coding/data course (DATSxxx)
  - 1 gen ed / writing / medium course (if gen ed remaining)

### March next-session draft (to decide before registration)
Candidate set (balanced):
- ARAB100 (finishes part of Arts & Humanities)
- DATS211 (Intro to Data Science)
- DATS200 (Functional Methods and Coding) OR a GenEd slot if needed
