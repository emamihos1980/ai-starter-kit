# Now (weekly)

## Current focus
- Repo: ai-starter-kit
- Goal: Build repeatable workflow (Python + SQL + Git) and small tests

## This week’s tasks (pick 2–3 max)
- [ ] Add a small pytest for `load_contoso_sqlite.py` (path exists + csv discovery)
- [ ] Add 3 starter SQL queries in `sql/` (SELECT, JOIN, GROUP BY)
- [ ] Add “How to run” section in README (you already have—just verify it matches reality)

## Commands I run often
- python src/load_contoso_sqlite.py
- pytest -q
- git status
